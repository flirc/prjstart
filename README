PRJSTART
========

prjstart is a generic C project framework. The buildsystem supports
both vanilla C and Cocoa projects. It works (has been tested) on
Linux and OS X.


Buildsystem
-----------

The Makefile and files under `buildsystem' should not need to be
modified. Targets are configured with target makefiles. Two examples
are under `targets'; one for a vanilla C project, and one for a Cocoa
project. Targets can support multiple build configs, such as debug
and release.

The target makefile can be specified on the make command line or
it can be linked to `target.mk'.

    $ make MKTARGET=targets/vanilla.mk
    [CC]            src/vanilla.c
    [CC]            lib/cmds.c
    [LINK]          buildresults/vanilla/Darwin_i386/gcc_4_2/debug/vanilla
    [CONFIG]        debug

Configs can also be specified on the command line. By default, the
first config in the CONFIGS list is used.

    $ make MKTARGET=targets/cocoa.mk CONFIG=release
    [OBJCC]         src/cocoa.m
    [CC]            lib/cmds.c
    [LINK]          buildresults/cocoa/Darwin_i386/gcc_4_2/release/cocoa
    [CONFIG]        release
