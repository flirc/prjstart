PRJSTART
========

prjstart is a generic C project framework. The buildsystem supports
both vanilla C and Cocoa projects. It works (has been tested) on
Linux and OS X.


Buildsystem
-----------

The Makefile and files under `buildsystem' should not need to be
modified. Targets are configured with target makefiles. Two examples
are under `targets'; one for a vanilla C project, and one for a Cocoa
project. Targets can support multiple build configs, such as debug
and release.

The target makefile can be specified on the make command line or
it can be linked to `target.mk'.

    make MKTARGET=targets/vanilla.mk

Configs can also be specified on the command line. By default, the
first config in the CONFIGS list is used.

    make MKTARGET=targets/vanilla.mk CONFIG=release
