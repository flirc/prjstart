PRJSTART
========

prjstart is a generic C project framework. The buildsystem supports
both vanilla C and Cocoa projects (OS X). It handles the C, Obj-C,
and C++ languages. It has been tested on Linux and OS X.


-----------
Buildsystem
-----------

The Makefile and files under `buildsystem' should not need to be
modified. Targets are configured with target makefiles. Two examples
are under `targets'; one for a vanilla C project, and one for a Cocoa
project. Targets can support multiple build configs, such as debug
and release.

The target makefile can be specified on the make command line or
it can be linked to `target.mk'.

::

    $ make MKTARGET=targets/vanilla.mk 
    [CC]            src/vanilla.c
    [CC]            lib/getline.c
    [CC]            lib/cmds.c
    [CC]            lib/cmds_script.c
    [CC]            lib/cmds_shell.c
    [LINK]          buildresults/vanilla/Darwin_i386/gcc_4_2/debug/vanilla
    [CONFIG]        debug

Configs can also be specified on the command line. By default, the
first config in the CONFIGS list is used.

::

    $ make MKTARGET=targets/cocoa.mk CONFIG=release
    [OBJCC]         src/cocoa.m
    [CC]            lib/getline.c
    [CC]            lib/cmds.c
    [CC]            lib/cmds_script.c
    [CC]            lib/cmds_shell.c
    [LINK]          buildresults/cocoa/Darwin_i386/gcc_4_2/release/cocoa
    [CONFIG]        release

Target Makefiles
++++++++++++++++

TARGET
    The name of the output executable. __TARGET__ is defined as the
    string version of this.

SOURCES
    List of all sources to compile for the target.

<CONFIG>_SOURCES
    Configuration specific sources.

LIBRARIES
    List of all required libraries to link against. Each library
    becomes a -l<library> flag during the link stage.
    NOTE: If you are using the standard C++ libary (e.g. iostream),
    you must add stdc++ to this list.

OPTIONS
    Global build options for all configurations. Each option becomes
    a -D<option> style flag.

<CONFIG>_OPTIONS
    Configuration specific options.

FRAMEWORKS
    List of frameworks to build against. (Obj-C)

All flags can be appended to in the target makefile as well. For
example, `CPPFLAGS += <flag>'
